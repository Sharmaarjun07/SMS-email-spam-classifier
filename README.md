# SMS-email-spam-classifier
This project involves building an SMS spam classifier with various Machine Learning Algorithms testing. The classifier accurately distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages, achieving high precision and accuracy. Implemented techniques like EDA, vectorization, tokenization, and stop word removal for meticulous data preparation. Tested multiple classifiers (including Logistic Regression, SVC, RandomForestClassifier etc), with MultinomialNB delivering the highest precision.
